      <h2>Welcome!</h2>
      <p>
        ...to Rock Paper Scissors Lizard Spock. A game where you choose
        between 5 different fighting options to best your opponent. Each
        option comes with its own qualities and abilities that can either best
        or be bested by the other four options. The different options along
        with the rules they follow are set below. Every time a round is won,
        either the player or the computer gains a point. The first to win three points
        is the overall winner of the game. If the same option is chosen by both player
        and computer then it is a draw, and no points are awarded. May the best player win!
      </p>
