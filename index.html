          ...to Rock Paper Scissors Lizard Spock. A game in which players choose
          between 5 different fighting options to best their opponents. Each
          option comes with its own qualities and abilities that can either best
          or be bested by the other four options. The different options along
          with the rules they follow are set below. Every time a round is one,
          the round-winning player gains a point. The first to win three point
          is the overall winner of the game, and if the two players choose the 
          same then it is a draw, and no points are awarded. The game is played
          between two people, a player one and a player two. Good luck to both!
        </p>
