# Project 2- JavaScript

The project is for a game of 'Rock paper scissors lizard Spock', a version of rock paper scissors but with an added two options a player can pick that are integrated into the game, meaning each new options have interacting moves with the rest of the others. The game comes from an American TV show called 'The Big Bang Theory' which is a show that celebrates self proclaimed 'nerd culture', meaning the show is a comedy written by nerds, for nerds, and celebrates this kind of culture as opposed to mocking it, still while including jokes that would also be described as 'nerdy'. The word nerd was originally an insult but the show and it's viewers have reclaimed it as something to identify by as a community and so the game I have created has been designed to appeal to this kind of culture, and i have engrained it into the user experience.

## The Icon

The icon plays a part in the spirit of The Big Bang Theory as one of the first things the users see. It is a cartoon picture of The 'Starship Enterprise', which is the ship that Spock is a crew member on. One of the jokes on Big Bang Theory is that the characters will use the game to settle arguments over for instance, what to watch on TV, but both characters usually pick Spock as he is a character they all really admire in the show 'Star Trek', a Sci-Fi franchise that is heavily referenced in the show. The icon acts as a 'if you know, you know' kind of thing that is part of the fun for the user, as the game is meant for people who are like minded to the show characters and are self confessed 'nerds' also.
