## Rock Paper Scissors Lizard Spock! An interactive game

The project is for a game of 'Rock paper scissors lizard Spock', a version of rock paper scissors but with an added two options a player can pick that are integrated into the game, meaning each new options have interacting moves with the rest of the others. The game comes from an American TV show called 'The Big Bang Theory' which is a show that celebrates self proclaimed 'nerd culture', meaning the show is a comedy written by nerds, for nerds, and celebrates this kind of culture as opposed to mocking it, still while including jokes that would also be described as 'nerdy'. The word nerd was originally an insult but the show and it's viewers have reclaimed it as something to identify by as a community and so the game I have created has been designed to appeal to this kind of culture, and I have engrained it into the user experience. The user plays against a the computer which selects it's own option and the two answers are compared and the winner is announced. The user can then go back to the game or the main menu once the winner is announced.

# Features

## The Icon

The icon plays a part in the spirit of The Big Bang Theory as one of the first things the users see. It is a cartoon picture of The 'Starship Enterprise', which is the ship that Spock is a crew member on. One of the jokes on Big Bang Theory is that the characters will use the game to settle arguments over for instance, what to watch on TV, but both characters usually pick Spock as he is a character they all really admire in the show 'Star Trek', a Sci-Fi franchise that is heavily referenced in the show. The icon acts as a 'if you know, you know' kind of thing that is part of the fun for the user, as the game is meant for people who are like minded to the show characters and are self confessed 'nerds' also.

### Metadata

Therefore, the keywords in the metadata I've included the name of the game, Star Trek and The Big Bang Theory, and included 'nerd culture' and 'nerd game' so to make the website easier to find for people looking for this kind of thing. As stated before, the word nerd is something that the people who are into this kind of thing and are into this kind of stuff identify as, so even if the word started off at a bit of an insult albeit not a particularly hurtful one, it most certainly isn't offensive in this context due to the audience identifying as such, and choosing to own the word.

## Font and Background

The font carries on with the 'nerdy' theme, I found it by going into google fonts and typing words such as 'space', 'star trek' and 'sci-fi' until I found a font looking more futuristic. A Sci-Fi themed website would obviously be really fitting for the demographic. The background follows this theme, as I looked on the internet for just a picture of outer space. The picure I settled for was my choice as for starters it didn't have as many stars in the background as other pictures, meaning it wasnt going to be a distraction for the user, and there would be less likelihood of the stars interfering with the silver font color I had chosen. I also knew if it had less stars then there would be less chance of it being obvious that the picture is repeating itself in the background. A more keen eyed user may notice that it is repeating across the whole background but it isn't obvious enough to affect user experience in any way. One last thing to add is that with the h1 in the header, there are full stops after every word followed by the exclamation mark at the end word to replicate how people say it when playing the game, like the way both players would count down and then have their answer by the time both shout Spock! at the end, further adding a bit of fun and taking the edge off as it is a game after all.
